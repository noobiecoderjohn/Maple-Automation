# maple-bot

This project aims to tackle the monotonous grind that players experience in MapleStory. 

This bot uses computer vision to find game features, being reliant on taking screenshots of the application window as a bitmap and parsing for pre-determined BGRA values. An implementation that accesses the game's memory could be faster but requires more maintenance and the knowledge to bypass game security. As this bot is external, it should undetected and functional throughout newer versions of the game unless changes are made affecting mini-map colors.
